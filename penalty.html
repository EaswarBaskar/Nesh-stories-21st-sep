            This policy outlines the conditions for a delay penalty if your project is not completed by the confirmed move-in date.
            <br><br>
            <span class="bold">What is a Delay Penalty?</span><br>
            A delay penalty is a discount given to you if your project handover is delayed by more than 15 days beyond the confirmed move-in date. The penalty is calculated at 0.1% of the total project value for each day of delay after this grace period.<br>
• The maximum penalty is capped at 3% of the total project value. <br>
• Penalties are issued as a cashback.
     <p class="paragraph">

    <span class="bold">When the Penalty is Not Applicable</span><br>
    The delay penalty is void and will not apply in the following situations:<br>
    - <span class="bold">Customer-Driven Changes:</span> Any changes to the design, materials, or scope of work after the move-in date is communicated.<br>
    - <span class="bold">Customer Responsibilities:</span> Delays caused by work or approvals handled by you, including site access, utility availability (power/water), and local authority approvals.<br>
    - <span class="bold">Payment Delays:</span> Non-payment, partial payments, or late payments.<br>
    - <span class="bold">Third-Party Issues:</span> Delays in production or delivery from third-party brands.<br>
    - <span class="bold">Force Majeure:</span> Events beyond our control, such as natural disasters, strikes, power failures, or unforeseen supply issues. Neshstories will notify you of such delays within 72 hours.
